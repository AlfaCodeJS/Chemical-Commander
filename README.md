# Chemical-Commander
Chemical Commander is a game that i made where you need to combine elements to make moleculas and combine moleculas to make life, planets and your objective is to creating an entire universe starting only by one hydrogen atom.

## How does it work?
Chemical Commander is coded in html, javascript, css and other programming languages. To read and update the data of elements, moleculas, and composts Chemical Commander uses jsonbin's Update and Read JSON API's to send GET and POST requests to the jsonbin's servers and get/update the information. 

If anyone was asking why i did not use SQL is because a few reasons (i don't wanna offend anyone):  
1. It needs PHP, and it's a language that's only server-side and i wanna make the game code downloadable to be played offline without needing to install the game into a server.  
2. SQL is just that it's not worth learning it just for only one game.  
3. JSON supports more technologies.  
4. I prefer JSON and i don't wanna learn some other language like XML.  
5. I personally think that JSON Databases are best than some other database that i can't mantain properly without messing something.  
6. It's easier for me to debug because i use Firefox that haves a built-in JSON debugger and rich JavaScript capabilities
